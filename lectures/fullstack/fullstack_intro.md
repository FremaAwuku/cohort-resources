## Logistics- TAs to PMs 
+ Everyone is going to be assigned one of the TAs as a project manager.  
+ Your PM will be like your supervisor for your fullstack.
+ Your PM will regularly review your progress and work and be there to offer guidance and answer questions for you.  
+ Your PM will typically be who answers your questions.
+ Questions and bugs during fullstacks tend to get a lot more difficult though, so it's likely that your PM will not always be available immediately.
+ It's important for you to now start building independence

## Logistics - Quality Metrics

  * Behavior / Interactions
2. Actively Functional
3. Error/Bug Free (Console)
4. Sufficient Seed Data/Images (see #1)

## Git Workflow
+ We work feature to feature using git and feature branching.  
  - Our main branch will always be a clean branch.  It will always have working code, even if that code doesn't do anything.
  - When we start a new feature, we will first start a new branch off of main.  
  - We will leave main untouched, and make all of the changes we want to our code on the feature branch.  
  - Once the feature branch is ready for review and is working, we will merge it into the main branch, and push the main branch up to heroku again.
