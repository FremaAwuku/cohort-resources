# Tips

Note:

These tips are general strategies for doing well on the assessment. 
---
# Tip 1
* for every if, def(function definition), loop etc... always place the corresponding end!
* Minimize silly bugs by practicing goo coding practice
---
# Tip 2
* Test Often! 
  * if you test often you'll have an easier time find the corresponding end you possibly missed
---
# Tip 3
* DEBUGGER, DEBUGGERS, DEBUGGERS
  * May seem like you don't have enough time. You're going to save a lot more time placing a debugger than just staring at your code trying to find the bug 
* stare for 10s then place debuggers to see whats going on 
* you get 3 seconds to freak out, then it't time to start debugging

Note: 

Assure them that they will run into bugs on the assessment. It's ok to run into bugs because they will have prepared enough all weekend to tackle any bugs that they may encounter.

# Tip 4
* you can test specs one at a time!
* you can also test all of a specific problems specs

Note: 

teseting specs one at a time will be demonstrated during the coding demo.

# Tip 5 
* do not get stuck on one question for too long
* make sure to hop around 
* look for the gimme questions 
---
# Tip 6
* do not leave infinite loops in your solutions
  * You will lose all of the points for that question
