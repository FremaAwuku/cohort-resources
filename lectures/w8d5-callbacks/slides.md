### Callbacks! and other stuff

![JavaScript-shade](https://i.redd.it/h7nt4keyd7oy.jpg)

Note:
+ lol
+ "JavaScript: The Good Parts" was a popular intro to the most useful features of ES5. ES5 really did deserve this joke. All the new features in ES6+ are "good parts" though. :D

---

## Today's Topics

+ Ruby vs ES5 vs ES6
+ Calling functions
+ Class Syntax
+ `call`, `apply`, `bind`
+ `arguments` object
+ Module Pattern
+ Callbacks
+ Event Loop

## [Ruby & JavaScript comparison chart](https://appacademy.github.io/curriculum/language_comparison/index.html)
#### _look back at it_

Note:
+ "ES" = ECMA Script
+ JS was made in a little over a week, and since then has seen update after update fill in the gaps to make it more dynamic, more semantic and keep it relevant. These updates are released as to push forward the standard of JS developing, but as you all can imagine they take some time to become fully supported and integrated
+ We will expose you all to ES5 syntax which is universally supported as well as ES6, despite there already being an ES7 and ES8 release.
+ And if that weren't already confusing, ES6 actually refers to the update released in 2015 otherwise known as ECMAScript2015

## Ways to call a function

* Function Style: `fun(arg1, arg2)`
* Method Style: `obj.method(arg1, arg2)`
* Constructor Style: `new`

---
# Quick Demo - Functions
---

## Class Syntax

* JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance
* class definition in ES5:
  * any function can be a class constructor
  * explicitly set keys on `prototype`
  * syntax is very different from Ruby
* class definition in ES6: syntactic sugar
  * creates same prototype structure as ES5
  * a more familiar, user-friendly syntax

---

# Demo - Class Syntax


Note:

Let's play around with our new, high-tech class syntax!

## Ways to call a function

* Function Style: `fun(arg1, arg2)`
* Method Style: `obj.method(arg1, arg2)`
* Constructor Style: `new`
##### NEW!
* Apply: `func.apply(newContext, [args])`
* Call: `func.call(newContext, arg1, arg2)`
* Bind: `func.bind(newContext)(arg1,arg2)`

---
## Binding

* call, apply, and bind all 'bind' a context to a function
* ensure our context is what we want it to be
* `bind()` returns a **function**
* Note: different from `call` and `apply` which **invoke** the function

---
# Demo - Call, Apply, and Bind

Note:

* Time for a **_code demo_** on `call`, `apply`, and `bind`.
* (Someone in Jon's cohort drew this back in 2013...)
* Check out the [console methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console).

---

## Arguments

* Functions happily accept more or fewer arguments than expected
* omitted arguments are set to `undefined` (if they have no default)
* Accessing extra arguments:
  * ES5: array-like `arguments` variable
  * ES6: rest/spread operator: `...`

Note:
* JavaScript is a very permissive language. It favors passing `undefined` over throwing an error.
* `...`
  * called "rest operator" when it takes the _rest_ of the arguments
  * called "spread operator" when it spreads out an array
* ES5 - had to use `Function.prototype.apply()` to do what spread now does

---

### Some different ways to convert `arguments` into an Array:

+ ES6: `Array.from(arguments)`
+ ES5: `Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments)`
+ Lazy ES5: `[].slice.apply(arguments)`
+ ðŸ˜® ES6: `[...arguments]`

## Arguments Clinic

![monty-python-argument-clinic](https://multimedia-english.com/recursos/contenidos/5b332af4cb618cc94c765a42085f1422.jpg)

Note:

* Demo arguments
* If you haven't seen [Monty Python's Argument Clinic sketch](](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohDB5gbtaEQ)), it's worth a watch.

## Module Pattern

* allows us to split our code into multiple files
  * like ruby's `require` and `require_relative`
* Two steps: exporting & importing

---

## Export

* `module.exports = {}`

## Import

* `require('relative/path')`

---

### Modules Demo

Note: send some drinks to my mom demo

don't forget to export!

---

## Let's Talk about Callbacks!

![thatd-be-great-callback](https://media.makeameme.org/created/if-you-could-phpoic.jpg)

---

## Callbacks

* Functions that are passed to other functions as arguments
* Allow us to build in asynchronicity into our programs

Note:

Remember that functions are first class objects and so can be stored and passed around like any other object.

---

### Demo Time!

---

## Event Loop

* Asynchronous functions schedule work to be done in the background
  * i.e. timers, AJAX requests, events
* Callbacks are invoked when action ready to occur & stack is empty
* [Event Loop Visualization](http://latentflip.com/loupe)

Note: draw event loop diagram on board
