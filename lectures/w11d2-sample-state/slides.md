## W11D2 FSP: Normalizing State Shape 

---

## Main Points: 
- Top-level estate shape - entities, ui, session, errors
- Proper way to store relational data

---

## Top Level State Shape
```js
{
	entities: {
		users: {},
		posts: {}
	},
	session: {
		currentUser: 1
	},
	ui: {
		modalOpen: true
	},
	errors: {
		userErrors: [],
		sessionErrors: [],
		postErrors: []
	}
}
```
- All relational data nested under entities
- Changes to session, ui,  errors, etc are handled by their own reducers/ slice of state

---

# Style
 - State shape is flat!
 - State's keys are camelCased
 - All keys within the values in the state are accessible in the schema

 - Sample state is rendered with triple backticks, and the language ```javascript...```). This will display the state as a code block instead of a giant line of text

---

## Storing relational data
- Store entities by their ID
- Single source of truth for each entity
	- No duplicated data
  - No nested data
  - State shape should closely resemble schema
- Joins tables get their own slice of state
- Redux docs for normalization tips üëç

# Summary for Normalizing State
+ Prevents repeated information/objects in our frontend state
+ Makes updating the state simpler and more efficient in our reducers.
+ Can prevent unnecessary re-renders of information in other components.

# Where does this go?
- In the repo for your FSP
- Go to Wiki tab
- Create a main page
- Create a state shape page
- Paste in your markdown
